Welcome to my blog's first post!
<!--more-->

I was working on my project the other day. I’m working on a desktop GUI project, which is not as popular as a web project nowadays. As a result, there are not that many online sources that I can refer to while working on it (not to mention the official documentation is not that good). So I was thinking, hey I should write this up so I can help my future self. While I’m at it I also think that writing it in a blog maybe is not a bad idea!

As you can see, my blog is a bit bare. I'm inspired by [this website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) for the design. Also, because it's mainly just for my note I think it's good to keep things simple and lightweight. Please let me know if you have any suggestions!

For now, I plan to write some posts related to desktop GUI software. More specifically on GTK and C. Please note that I’m not a professional C engineer by any means (I write java for a living, like your everyday software engineer). So, I’m sorry if most of my post only consists of surface-level knowledge or even contains any errors. Please let me know if that happened. You can send me an [email](mailto:contact@matiasalvin.dev) or contact me on my socials.

So, as I’ve already mentioned. This blog will be mainly used as my notes on my software engineer journeys. Also, I’m not a native speaker. Hopefully, by writing a lot of English I can be better at my English. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy your stay here!
